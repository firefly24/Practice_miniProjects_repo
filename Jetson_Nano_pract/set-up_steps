Documenting the Jetson Orin Nano set-up steps, in case needed in future

HW required: 
1. Jetson Orin Nano Development Board (+ power adapter)
2. HDMI/DP monitor + DP dongle/cable 
3. USB wired/wireless keyboard and mouse
4. microSD card 256GB for first boot
5. microSD card reader for flashing jetpack image onto the microSD card
6. Wifi and Bluetooth USB adapter for connectivity on jetson Board
7. (Optional for better performance) NVMe SSD 1TB PCIe card for better memory access - use PCIe Gen3


Setup Steps followed: 

1. Followed the NVDIA official guide for first boot with JetPack 6.2 through microSD card:

2. Using Wifi adapter for internet connectivity, I downloaded chromium browser and miniconda3 for jetson nano , as Anaconda is not compatible with ARM64 platforms.

3. Migrate from microSD to boot from SSD for faster performance, using below guides from JetsonHacks:
