# 🚀 Embedded AI & Robotics Roadmap

This repository tracks my **learning path** from Embedded Linux & C++ → CUDA → AI on Jetson → Robotics/UAV.  
The goal is to transition into **Embedded AI / Robotics Engineer** roles.

## 🎯 Roadmap Milestones

### 📍 Milestone 1: Core Embedded Linux & Multithreading
- Strengthen **C++ concurrency & synchronization**  
- Write **Linux device drivers** (char, sysfs, I2C/SPI, IRQ)  
- Target Role: *Embedded Linux Engineer*

---

### 📍 Milestone 2: GPU & CUDA Programming
- Learn **CUDA basics** (threads, blocks, memory hierarchy)  
- Implement **matrix multiplication, filters, profiling**  
- Target Role: *GPU/Accelerator Software Engineer*

---

### 📍 Milestone 3: AI on Embedded
- Learn **Python + OpenCV** for AI workloads  
- Run **ONNX/TensorRT inference** on Jetson Nano  
- Target Role: *Edge AI Engineer*

---

### 📍 Milestone 4: Robotics / UAV
- Learn **ROS2 basics** (pub/sub, services, actions)  
- Work with **PX4 autopilot & Gazebo simulations**  
- Implement **trajectory control + object tracking**  
- Target Role: *Robotics / UAV Engineer*

---

## ✅ Progress Tracking

All tasks are tracked as **GitHub Issues** organized into milestones:
- Each issue = one project/learning task.  
- Each milestone = a career-relevant skill set.  

You can view them under the **Projects** tab or in the issue tracker.
